## My Philosophy

Two principles guide how I live and work:

**1. See the good first.**  
I try to find the best in people, situations, and problems. Every person has something worth learning from. Every system, no matter how broken, has something it does right. This mindset helps me build better relationships, better software, and better solutions.

**2. Trust the process.**  
I believe that outcomes take care of themselves if you do your part well. So I focus on what I can control: showing up, learning, and improving. The rest falls into place over time.

These two ideas shape how I approach engineering, teamwork, and growth.
